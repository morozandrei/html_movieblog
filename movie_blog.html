                    <h2>4) Apollo 13</h2>
                    
                    <p align="justify">I don't know what the real event was like, because I wasn't even born then, but I guess it must have been really
                    shocking to see how these astronauts were fighting for their lives. The movie really has done a good job on showing how
                    inventive people can be in times of need, and on recreating the emotions that the crew, their families and the people in
                    the flight command center had to go through.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p align="justify">If you ask me, the film really was at its best as soon as the crew was actually taking off in their rocket. Before that
                    the movie was a little bit too slow to my taste and it didn't have that much to say. However, from the moment the
                    problems with Apollo 13 started I was sitting on the edge of my seat. It all felt very real and you just have to
                    empathize with the crew and their family.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p align="justify">Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton,... all did a great job showing us the astronauts, their
                    families and the flight crew on this doomed mission. Their performances made "Apollo 13" one of the better movies of the
                    nineties.

                    <p align="justify">Astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway has long been interested in contact to faraway lands, a love fostered in her childhood by
                    her father, Ted Arroway (David Morse), who died when she was nine-years-old, leaving her orphaned. Her current work in
                    monitoring for extraterrestrial life is based on that love and is in part an homage to her father. Ever since funding
                    from the National Science Foundation (N.S.F.) was pulled on her work, which is referred to some, including her N.S.F.
                    superior David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt), as more science fiction than science, Ellie, with a few of her rogue scientist
                    colleagues, have looked for funding from where ever they could get it to continue their work.
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p align="justify">When Ellie and her colleagues hear chatter originating from the vicinity of the star Vega, 
                    Ellie feels vindicated. But that vindication is short lived when others, including politicians, the military,
                    religious leaders, and other scientists, such as Drumlin,
                    try to take over her work.

                    <h2>2) Interstellar</h2>
                    
                    <p align="justify">This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I
                    am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his
                    lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no
                    idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I
                    have never seen anything like it.
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p align="justify">One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not
                    like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not.

                    <h2 align="right">1) 2001: A Space Odyssey</h2>
                    <p align="justify">Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people
                    have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have
                    never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of
                    the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of
                    hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning
                    filmgoers will understand.
                    </p>

                    <p align="justify">Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric
                    characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be
                    remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial.
                    It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to
                    the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his
                    own time, and for everyone else to marvel at.
